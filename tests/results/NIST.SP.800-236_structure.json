    "text": "FOREWORD -------------------------- Back to the future. As we look back on our past fiscal year\u2019s work in cybersecurity and privacy, we can see the fruition of many long-standing efforts that will position us well in the changing times ahead. NIST has set foundations to ensure our security and privacy now and into the future with new quantum- resistant encryption algorithms, updates to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and the establishment of Artificial Intelligence programs, testbeds, and research agendas. Our research has also demonstrated practical applications of our work that spans several key priority areas that are outlined in this report with hyperlinked pointers to help you dig deeper and learn more. NIST\u2019s work aligns with and supports many national initiatives to protect our Nation, including the National Cybersecurity Strategy and its related Implementation Plan, new policies for federal agencies from the Office of Management and Budget, initiatives from the Office of the National Cyber Director, and response actions directed by the National Security Council. NIST leads many standards- setting organizations around the world and ensures that U.S. priorities, requirements, and technologies are at the forefront of standards activities. This enables the development of products and services that meet our needs and are unquestionably secure. We are proud of and excited about the relevance and impact of our work as we continue to protect our information, economy, and way of life. We hope that you will take the time to review some of the key highlights of our cybersecurity and privacy accomplishments from FY 2024 and to explore some of our priorities, programs, and projects. You can learn about the many conferences and workshops we had in the last fiscal year by viewing the recordings or reading the event proceedings, and we invite you to participate directly with us in our upcoming events. Most importantly, we look forward to learning more from you as we work together to address the challenges of today and journey into the future. As ever, we appreciate your support and hope that you are making the best possible use of NIST\u2019s work.

The standards, guidelines, recommendations, and tools provided by NIST\u2019s Cryptography priority area enable the trustworthy assurance of integrity and confidentiality in all types of information and technology \u2014 now and in the future. Major Accomplishments in FY 2024: \u2022 NIST published the first three Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for post- quantum cryptography. These standards specify key-establishment and digital signature schemes that are designed to resist future attacks by quantum computers, which threaten the security of current standards. The three algorithms specified in these standards are each derived from different submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standardization Project. \u2022 The PQC team hosted the Fifth PQC Standardization Conference in April 2024. This conference discussed the finalization of the initial PQC FIPS and the ongoing evaluation of the Round 4 Public-Key Encryption and Key-Establishment Algorithms and the Additional Digital Signature Schemes that are being considered for future standardization. \u2022 The Multi-Party Threshold Cryptography (MPTC) and Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography (PEC) projects jointly released the initial public draft of NIST Internal Report (IR) 8214C, NIST First Call for Multi-Party Threshold Schemes (MPTS). The document\u2019s scope includes advanced techniques, such as fully homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and the building blocks of secure multi-party computation. As part of an effort to obtain public comments, NIST hosted the MPTS 2023 workshop and three events of the Special Topics on Privacy and Public Auditability (STPPA). \u2022 NIST\u2019s Crypto Publication Review Board completed seven publication reviews, and five reviews are in progress to update and modernize the portfolio of cryptographic standards.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2024: \u2022 A major update to the NICE Framework was released as the Version 1.0.0 Components, which incorporated changes to almost every level of the NICE Framework\u2019s structure and includes a list of 11 learner-focused Competency Areas. The new Components were released in multiple data formats, including as part of NIST\u2019s Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool. \u2022 NIST released two new resources in support of the NICE Strategic Plan Goal 4.6: \u201cExpand international outreach to promote the NICE Framework and document approaches being used in other countries.\u201d The new NICE Framework components have been translated into five languages, and a list of international Cybersecurity Skills and Workforce Frameworks is now available. The list includes a representative sample of cybersecurity, cyber-related, digital literacy skills, and workforce frameworks from countries around the world. \u2022 The NICE Community Coordinating Council\u2019s Promote Career Discovery Working Group launched the Cybersecurity Career Ambassador Program. The Transform Learning Process Working Group published the Landscape of Performance-Based Assessments in Cybersecurity. \u2022 The Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Group published an update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-50r1 (Revision 1), Building a Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program. \u2022 The Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate (RAMPS) Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Development Program awarded cooperative agreements totaling nearly $6.6 million aimed at building the workforce needed to safeguard enterprises from cybersecurity risks. The grants of roughly $200,000 apiece were distributed to 33 education and community organizations in 22 states that are working to address the nation\u2019s shortage of skilled cybersecurity employees.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2024: \u2022 The phishing project team published the NIST Phish Scale User Guide handbook on applying the Phish Scale \u2014 a novel method for measuring socially engineered email attacks. The guide has been downloaded over 20,000 times since its release. The Phish Scale is used in public- and private-sector organizations around the world to aid those who manage phishing awareness training programs in enhancing training effectiveness and strengthening organizations\u2019 security postures. \u2022 The youth security and privacy project team continued participation in the White House Kids Online Health and Safety (KOHS) Task Force. NIST provided technical expertise and worked with multi-agency colleagues in three task force working groups to deliver a first-of-its-kind report, Best Practices for Families and Guiddlines for Industry. This report includes: (1) best practices for parents and caregivers to promote youth online health, safety, and privacy; (2) recommended industry practices; (3) a research agenda that identifies domains of further inquiry; and (4) recommended next steps for policymakers. \u2022 NIST published results from practitioner and researcher survey studies that explored how human-centered cybersecurity concepts can be better integrated into practice and how practitioners can better inform human-centered cybersecurity research. To address some of the challenges identified in the studies, NIST launched the Human-Centered Cybersecurity Community of Interest, an online forum that brings practitioners and researchers together to share perspectives and facilitate collaboration. NIST also co-sponsored and served on the organizing committee for ConnectCon, an interactive workshop that brings together cybersecurity experts from academia, industry, and government to identify and discuss the most pressing human-centered cybersecurity challenges that organizations face today.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation\u2019s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL\u2019s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost- effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal information systems.
