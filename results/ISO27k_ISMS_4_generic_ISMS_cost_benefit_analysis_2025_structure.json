Page 2 of 6 \nIntroduction , scope and purpose  \nAdopting the ISO/IEC 27000  information security standards  (commonly known as \u201cISO27k\u201d) \ngenerally starts with a discrete implementation project to specify, design, develop and launch the \nInformation Security Management System (ISMS).  The ISMS systematically determines and aligns \nthe organisation\u2019s information security practices with its information risks.  Once up to speed , the \nISMS operate s indefinitely , directing and controlling information security using the its governance  \narrangements, management processes , strategies and policies . \nThis paper identifies the business implications of an ISO27k ISMS as a set of typical or commonplace \nbenefits and costs .  It is generic since we have no knowledge of your specific information assets, \nrisks or security controls .  \nWe have provided checkboxes for you to select items that you feel are or are not relevant .  This is \nnot a totally comprehensive list however, so you may well think of others  to add . \nFeel free to use this template both as a source of inspiration for your own ISMS business case, \nbudget request or project proposal to management, and as a framework for measuring and \noptimi sing the net value of your ISMS over the long term ( e.g. combining ISACA\u2019s Val IT approach  \nwith PRAGMATIC metrics ).   \n \nISMS business benefits  \nThese are the ways in which an ISO27k ISMS typically benefit s the organi sation . \nInformation security risk  reduction  \n\uf0f0 Strengthens existing information security control environment by (re -)emphasi sing business \ninformation security control requirements, upgrading current information security policies, \ncontrols etc. and providing stimulus to review and where necessary improve information \nsecurity controls periodically \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 Systematic, c omprehensive, well -structured approach  increases the likelihood that all \nrelevant information security threats , vulnerabilities  and impacts  are identified , assessed \nand treated rationally  \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 Professional, standardi sed and rational risk management approach gives consistency across \nmultiple IT systems and business processes over time, and addresses information risks \naccording to their relative priorities  or significance \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 A proactive, forward -thinking approach increases the organisation\u2019s resilience and \nadaptability in the face of significant uncertainties regarding cyber threats, the effectiveness \nand coverage of information security , competitive pressures  etc. \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 Increases our ability to share  certain information risks selectively with insurer s or other third \nparties , and may facilitate  negotiati ng reduce d insurance premiums as key controls are \nimplemented  and managed  \u2013 cost saving  \n\uf0f0 Managers and staff become increasingly familiar with information security terms , risks and  \ncontrols , more risk -aware, more competent and willing to respond appropriately  \u2013 risk \nreduction  "

Page 2 of 6 \nIntroduction , scope and purpose  \nAdopting the ISO/IEC 27000  information security standards  (commonly known as \u201cISO27k\u201d) \ngenerally starts with a discrete implementation project to specify, design, develop and launch the \nInformation Security Management System (ISMS).  The ISMS systematically determines and aligns \nthe organisation\u2019s information security practices with its information risks.  Once up to speed , the \nISMS operate s indefinitely , directing and controlling information security using the its governance  \narrangements, management processes , strategies and policies . \nThis paper identifies the business implications of an ISO27k ISMS as a set of typical or commonplace \nbenefits and costs .  It is generic since we have no knowledge of your specific information assets, \nrisks or security controls .  \nWe have provided checkboxes for you to select items that you feel are or are not relevant .  This is \nnot a totally comprehensive list however, so you may well think of others  to add . \nFeel free to use this template both as a source of inspiration for your own ISMS business case, \nbudget request or project proposal to management, and as a framework for measuring and \noptimi sing the net value of your ISMS over the long term ( e.g. combining ISACA\u2019s Val IT approach  \nwith PRAGMATIC metrics ).   \n \nISMS business benefits  \nThese are the ways in which an ISO27k ISMS typically benefit s the organi sation . \nInformation security risk  reduction  \n\uf0f0 Strengthens existing information security control environment by (re -)emphasi sing business \ninformation security control requirements, upgrading current information security policies, \ncontrols etc. and providing stimulus to review and where necessary improve information \nsecurity controls periodically \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 Systematic, c omprehensive, well -structured approach  increases the likelihood that all \nrelevant information security threats , vulnerabilities  and impacts  are identified , assessed \nand treated rationally  \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 Professional, standardi sed and rational risk management approach gives consistency across \nmultiple IT systems and business processes over time, and addresses information risks \naccording to their relative priorities  or significance \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 A proactive, forward -thinking approach increases the organisation\u2019s resilience and \nadaptability in the face of significant uncertainties regarding cyber threats, the effectiveness \nand coverage of information security , competitive pressures  etc. \u2013 risk reduction  \n\uf0f0 Increases our ability to share  certain information risks selectively with insurer s or other third \nparties , and may facilitate  negotiati ng reduce d insurance premiums as key controls are \nimplemented  and managed  \u2013 cost saving  \n\uf0f0 Managers and staff become increasingly familiar with information security terms , risks and  \ncontrols , more risk -aware, more competent and willing to respond appropriately  \u2013 risk \nreduction  "

Better \ninformation security , in turn,  will reduce  the risk (probability of occurrence and/or adverse \nimpacts) of incidents, cutting incident -related losses and costs.   \n \n \nISMS implementation and operational costs \nMost of the costs associated with information security would be incurred anyway since \ninformation security is a business and compliance imperative.  The additional  costs \nspecifically relating to the ISMS mainly relate to the implementation project , changes to \ngovernance and security management arrangements, and certification (optional).  \n"
