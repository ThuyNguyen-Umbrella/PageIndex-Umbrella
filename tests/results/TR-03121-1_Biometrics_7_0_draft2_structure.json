        "text": "2.1 Motivation and Objectives of Technical Guideline Biometrics Biometric methods are used in many different areas of applications. The solutions and systems available on the market are able to serve a broad range regarding performance, security, usability and standard confor mance. For public sector applications, it is necessary to define precise requirements and general conditions. Furthermore, the systems have to be defined in a way which allows for extension in future developments. The objective of this Technical Guideline (TR Biometrics) is to offer a basis for a consistent and comparable quality of public sector applications and for building a common architecture. This guideline has the following objectives: \u2022 Modularity: The complete guideline is built from several single guideline modules. For a single application area only the respective modules have to be taken into account. This is done in order to avoid side effects between different kinds of applications which would occur due to changes of special functions. \u2022 Clarity: The concept of this guideline follows a well structured framework. With this framework it is easily understandable which kind of guideline modules are valid for the respective application scenario. \u2022 Expandability: Modularity is the key component of expandability in the scope of this guideline. This is valid regarding new applications as well as new functional units. \u2022 Standard conformance: The Technical Guideline takes national and international standards and guidelines into account and deploys them for governmental applications. \u2022 Conformance and certification: The guideline modules are designed in such a way that requirements and conditions for single functional units are clearly separated from each other. Products for single functional units are clearly defined regarding the interfaces and the range of their functionality so that they can be tested for conformance with this guideline and certified. \u2022 Ability to reference: The use of functional units allows to specify precise requirements for products that are used in according application scenarios. Therefore, this guideline can be used as a reference e.g. for tenders. \u2022 Market orientation: The definition of functional units is related to the products that can be found on the market. Requirements of the guideline can be unambiguously assigned to the respective systems and com ponents. It should be noted that the content of this guideline is limited to the aspects of biometric characteristics. In terfaces to further technologies (e.g. connection of optical or electronic document readers) are out of scope of this document.",

It explains the concept and the relation between the different parts. \u2022 Part 2: Software Architecture (TR-03121-2) The High Level Biometric Services (HLBS) as well as Service Definitions for specific use cases are specified here. \u2022 Part 3: Application Profiles, Function Modules and Processes (TR-03121-3) \u2022 In the third part, the different Application Profiles with corresponding Partial Application Processes and Function Modules are defined. These contain the detailed technical requirements for each of the com ponents. \u2022 Application Profiles may reference Function Modules, Partial Application Processes and Service De finitions (refer to Part 2). \u2022 Partial Application Processes may refer to Function Module Categories and may be comprised of Tasks.

    "text": "4 How to use this Technical Guideline 4 How to use this Technical Guideline This chapter gives a short overview how to read and apply this guideline step by step. 1. The user chooses the desired Application Profile. With the help of the Application Profile the user can get a deeper insight into the application, the required software architecture components and the described functionality. TR-03121-2 offers further information about the software architecture component model. 2. Based on the Application Profile, the mandatory Partial Application Processes and Function Modules are identified. One profile can link to several Partial Application Processes and Function Modules due to dif ferent kinds of underlying biometric characteristics or the fact that different technologies (e.g. scanners or digital cameras for the digitisation of a photo) are used. Function Modules are referenced by an explicit identifier, e.g. AH-FP-GID. The first part identifies the requirement type (e.g. Hardware), the second part represents the biometric characteristic (e.g. fingerprint), and the last part denotes a further descriptor, typically the scope (e.g. German Identity Document). Function Modules for different biometric characteristics are divided by a comma while a choice between different technologies is denoted by a slash (e.g. AH-FP-FTR, AH-PH-FBS/AH-PH-DC). If a Function Module is denoted with a placeholder between a less-than and greater-than sign (< >) the actual referenced Function Module is dependant on the context in which the Function Module has been mentioned. For example the Function Module AH-FI-<VL> has been mentioned within a Partial Applica tion Process used in the BCL volume, then the actual referenced Function Module is AH-FI-BCL. The sa me procedure holds for Application Profiles denoted as <AP> analogously. If no specific Function Module applies, then there are no further requirements defined for this context. Partial Application Processes are referenced by an explicit identifier, refer to Partial Application Profile section. 3. On the basis of the identifier the according Function Module and Partial Application Processes can be ex amined. Every Function Module and Partial Application Process provides detailed technical requirements and recommendations. Note, each reference to a Function Module or Partial Application Processes is a link within the document. 10 Federal Office for Information Security",

Primary Information Item Function Module Category Description AH Acquisition Hardware Devices that are used for digitising phy sical representable biometric characte ristics are called Acquisition Hardware. Scanners for capturing photographs, di gital cameras to capture facial images, fingerprint sensors, or signature tablets can be named as examples. AS Acquisition Software Acquisition Software encapsulates all functionality regarding image proces sing except for biometric purposes. The refore, this module usually contains de vice driver software for the Acquisiti on Hardware or in general software that is very close to the physical hardware. Furthermore, colour management and image enhancement mechanisms are often part of this software layer. BIP Biometric Image Processing The module Biometric Image Proces sing provides the extraction of all rele vant biometric information from the data, which is provided by the Acquisi tion Hardware or the Acquisition Soft ware layer. Thus, a proprietary data block is transformed to a digital image of a biometric characteristic. In gene ral, specific image processing for bio metric characteristics is addressed he re e.g. provision of full frontal images or segmentation of fingerprints. CMP Biometric Comparison The module Biometric Comparison en closes the mechanisms and algorithms to verify or identify an identity based on a one-to-one or one-to-many biometric comparison between reference data and a current biometric sample (usually a live presented image) no matter where the reference is stored. COD Coding This module contains the procedures to code logging data as well as biometric data in defined formats. Interoperability is provided by means of standard comp liant coding. Federal Office for Information Security 13 7 Organisation of the Function Modules Primary Information Item Function Module Category Description COM Compression The objective of the module Compres sion is to keep the biometric data be low a feasible size without losing too much quality for biometric verification or identification. EVA Evaluation Methods and interfaces which are used in the scope of evaluation are the con tent of this module. LOG Logging The module Logging contains require ments how and in which modality data has to be logged. O Operation Within the module Operation, the working process is specified for the re spective operator. PAD Presentation Attack Detection The Presentation Attack Detection mo dules give requirements on fake detec tion. This encloses, among other things, functionality and certification require ments. QA Quality Assessment This module contains all kinds of me chanisms and procedures to check the quality of the biometric data or to select the best quality data out of multiple in stances. Quality Assessment is typical ly used in evaluation of an application's performance over time. REF Reference Storage The objective of this module is to store biometric data in a way that it can be used for reference purposes later on. UI User Interface The User Interface modules give requi rements on visualization and user in teraction. This encloses, among other things, functionality, quality assurance information, and veto messages.

The basic structure of an ID is: \"PAP (Task) AAA-BBB-CCC-#\". Here, \"Task\" is optional and is only used if the PAP is a task. AAA is the primary information item, pointing to the main contents. BBB and CCC are optional information items, which can further specify the PAP. These information items may be one to six alphanumeric digits. The abbreviations used for the PAP IDs are listed in Table 8.1 and Table 8.2. All PAP IDs end with a number #. This number is usually 1, unless multiple IDs with similar preceding information items exist. In this case, they are enumerated increasingly.
