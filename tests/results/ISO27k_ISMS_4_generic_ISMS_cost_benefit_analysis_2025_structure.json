An ISMS business case template building on this paper is provided in the SecAware ISMS Take-off package, along with other materials for the management audience \u2013 briefings, advisories, policies, procedures, job descriptions, audit checklists etc. Document history 2025: revised several items. Added \u201cmaturity\u201d as a benefit class. Added \u2018clarity\u2019 as a maturity benefit. 2023: minor but important correction re accreditation. Change to UK/NZ English. 2022: revised for ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC 27002:2022. Red/green colouring added. 2012 and 2017: revisions. 2008: first public release of the generic business case as part of the free ISO27k Toolkit. 1995-2008: underlying concept gradually developed and refined by IsecT Ltd. through a number of project proposals, security strategies etc. with various organisations.
