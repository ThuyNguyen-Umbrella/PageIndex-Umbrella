Remember, airplane mode does not prevent spyware from functioning. \u2192Avoid exchanging sensitive information via SMS and prefer messaging apps that use end-to-end encryption to ensure the confidentiality of your exchanges. \u2192Be vigilant about phishing messages, which can disguise illegitimate requests to associate new devices with a messaging account. If any doubt exists, confirm as far as possible the origin and the legitimacy of the message. If you receive alerts (emails, SMS, etc.) from solution providers warning of a potential compromise of an account or device, contact CERT-FR by email at cert-fr@ssi.gouv.fr or by phone at 3218 (free service + cost of a call) or +33 (0) 9 70 83 32 18. In the context of the proliferation of threats targeting mobile phones, ANSSI recommends adopting the following 10 best practice rules for using mobile phones : \u2192Systematically update your operating system and applications as soon as possible. Regularly restarting your device can also limit the impact of non- persistent compromises. \u2192Activate the operating system\u2019s hardening mechanisms (ie. the Lockdown Mode in the iOS environment), particularly for high-risk populations. \u2192Never connect your digital devices to unknown equipment (chargers, storage devices, computers, etc.) or to public Wi-Fi networks. \u2192Uninstall and/or disable unused applications and features. Also, limit the applications\u2019 permissions. \u2192Disable wireless interfaces such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and location services when not in use. \u2192Maintain a strict separation between personal and professional use. \u2192Completely turn off your devices when you need to leave them unattended.",
